            <p>Studies show that information within organizations flows in one of three ways, either hierarchically or interpersonally (see the arrows on the organizational chart I displayed):
                Information can flow top-down, or hierarchically from those higher in the organization (at a more global scope) to those lower (with a more local scope).
                Info can flow bottom-up: it originates from a specific interaction at a lower level and is passed up through the ranks.
                Flow via people called social hubs: within organizations these people are often administrators or receptionists. They are people who interact with a lot of other people. 
                Notice how on this org chart the hub might appear to be an isolated from other people. But if you looked at true social network, you would see that the hub person is at the center of the action.</p>
